# Organon
A pre-jQuery DOM-Collection framework

Organon is an old framework, but still has its implementations, which use Organon to render almost-HTML-free web pages.

I haven't touched it in years, and maintain it here mainly for JS archaeologists.

(It may also be found on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/organon/).)
